# Experimental MBR-06/07/08 integrated recovery — candidate evidence

Status: **IMPLEMENTED THROUGH MBR-08 / PHYSICAL ACCEPTANCE PENDING**

Date: 2026-09-20

## Isolation

This execution is intentionally isolated from the accepted baseline.

- product branch: `experimental/mbr08-integrated-recovery-20260920`
- planner branch: `experimental/mbr08-integrated-recovery-20260920`
- base: MBR-05 `7f294a7fac9eebe226ad66c6b572582c5e483421`
- integrated implementation commit: `f13611d9bc6d28c54250445cbb268271f58c8efa`
- integrated firmware/manifest head before simulator tooling: `4297054d0573ce908ec81b2e2b82d9d428a5eee8`
- current product branch HEAD with host LCD simulator/backlight model: `62d19fcd14e16131c2d9e17d1cd7b9cc6c1a2955`
- no merge into `main`, `mbr/rebuild-00-through-04`, or `mbr/mbr-05-ble-mouse`

The user explicitly authorized bypassing intermediate physical-gate dependency so MBR-06, MBR-07 and MBR-08 could be implemented and corrected together. That bypass permits implementation sequencing only; it does not declare physical PASS.

## Implemented scope

### MBR-05 recovery items
- BLE discovery accepts HID evidence split between advertisement and scan response.
- Mouse appearance may qualify discovery without requiring the HID UUID in one packet.
- FIRST 8-second renewal no longer cancels in-flight connection/security/HIDS qualification.
- identity/public address aliases are normalized for saved/new filtering.
- ancillary non-keyboard HID collections no longer cause a valid Mouse to be rejected.
- USB mount/resume releases output without tearing down Bluetooth.
- radio initialization retry and late-cancellation safety are implemented.

### MBR-06
- Passthrough, Standard, Escape and Custom runtime mappings.
- per-Mouse confirmed profile, global applied Custom template, persistent dirty draft.
- source ownership/refcounts and release-safe profile changes.
- dual-slot versioned CRC32 product storage with integrity fallback and write verification.
- product state separated from BTstack credentials.
- bounded saved reconnect support.
- Logitech HID++ Forward diversion/hold/release adaptation with generic fallback.

### MBR-07
- repeated FIRST search cycles, 8-second SEARCH_SAVED, 15-second Pair New.
- one authoritative Mouse plus one non-authoritative replacement transport.
- saved peers ignored as Pair New winners.
- old Mouse remains usable while new Mouse is discovered/qualified.
- release/disconnect/persist/promote handoff.
- persistent registry up to 16 mice.
- transactional removal with pending tombstone and credential-cleanup recovery.
- last saved removal returns to first-Mouse search.
- stale/late session completion isolation.

### MBR-08
- real profile, Custom draft/apply and removal requests wired to runtime/storage.
- real asynchronous connection/search state projection.
- Saved Devices live/disconnected projection without stealing the current page.
- Help ownership/return and preserved search deadline.
- HOME resolver, Pair New flow, Lock/Learn behavior and existing 30-screen literal/layout contract retained.
- HOME title/suffix and gray/white action styling retained.

The final documentation-only manifest commit rebuilt to the same UF2 hashes as the integrated implementation commit.

## Physical acceptance

Physical acceptance remains pending. Execute the 37 numbered scenarios in product repository
`docs/implementation/08-manual-tests.md` using the production UF2 above.

MBR-09 and MBR-10 are outside this recovery and remain backlog.


## Host virtual LCD/HAT simulator

The experimental branch now contains an interactive host simulator that directly reuses the production application state machine, UI projector and RGB565 renderer.

- backend: `tools/lcd_simulator/mbr_lcd_simulator.c`
- GUI: `tools/lcd_simulator.py`
- documentation: `docs/implementation/09-host-lcd-simulator.md`
- default virtual LCD scale: 3x = 720x720
- HAT controls: keyboard arrows, Enter/Space and A/B/X/Y, plus on-screen buttons
- deterministic event injection: Mouse READY/disconnect, +1s/+8s/+15s, HOME, reboot and factory-reset
- simulated profile/draft/removal operations are auto-confirmed so complete UI flows can be exercised
- final simulator host CI run: `35537812476`
- host result: **16/16 PASS**, including `lcd_simulator_smoke` and `lcd_simulator_gui_syntax`

The simulator does not emulate RP2350, CYW43/BTstack, TinyUSB, physical flash interruption or ST7789 electrical/SPI timing; physical-gate acceptance remains unchanged.


### Backlight simulation

The virtual LCD now separates the logical RGB565 framebuffer from display illumination.

- 100% = digital RGB565 reference;
- 0–400% global virtual backlight gain, applied equally to all RGB channels;
- values above 100% are inspection gain only, useful for the frozen dark-magenta `0x0801` that is nearly black at digital reference;
- black remains black;
- channel values saturate at 255;
- Lock on a screen that owns `KEY Y: LOCK` forces effective backlight to 0% while preserving the selected gain and logical framebuffer;
- unlock restores the selected gain;
- desktop GUI uses a dark theme and exposes 100/200/300/400% presets plus a 0–400% slider.

Current host verification run: `35539030541`.
Host result: **16/16 PASS**, including simulator smoke, GUI syntax, architecture and canonical screens.

This is a visual inspection model, not a photometrically calibrated model of Waveshare backlight PWM/nits.
