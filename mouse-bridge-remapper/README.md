# Mouse Bridge Remapper planning

Status: **EXPERIMENTAL RECOVERY IMPLEMENTED THROUGH MBR-08 / PHYSICAL ACCEPTANCE PENDING. MBR-00 through MBR-04 remain physically accepted; MBR-05 through MBR-08 are isolated on the experimental branch.**

This directory is the planning source of truth for `tiagooliveirajs/mouse-bridge-remapper`.

## Goal

Rebuild the Mouse portion of physically accepted BLU2USB through G06 as a cleaner Mouse-only Bluetooth product with:

- BLE HOGP Mouse transport only;
- multiple saved Mouse records;
- zero or one authoritative live Mouse;
- Pair New new-only replacement handoff;
- frozen Mouse remap profiles including synthetic Escape;
- HOME-driven saved reconnect;
- documentation as product, code as consequence.

Accepted historical migration reference:

- repo `tiagooliveirajs/blu2usb`;
- branch `gate/g06-profiles-remap-logitech-hidpp`;
- accepted SHA `7eee024ad4ee726c5a85ffa2f32b9f47187878af`;
- accepted UF2 SHA-256 `d32819b99ec349cc36882aaeaf9e84000a98dc3dcd86238ed364fd01301c8f88`.

G07+ Keyboard work is research evidence only.

## Current frozen product highlights

- one authoritative connected Mouse maximum;
- current Mouse stays live while Pair New searches;
- first valid unsaved replacement candidate triggers a safe handoff;
- Pair New timeout/cancel before handoff leaves current Mouse live;
- connected HOME presents the current Mouse name as title and exposes `PAIR NEW MOUSE` as its first visible option;
- connected HOME remap summary is the second option and opens `remapper-options`;
- connected HOME Saved Devices and Learn the Keys remain the third and fourth options;
- saved candidates are ignored as Pair New winners;
- to reconnect saved instead, unplug current Mouse and Back until HOME reaches SEARCHING;
- HOME with saved mice + no live Mouse starts 8-second saved search automatically;
- first-Mouse search repeats 8-second cycles until success;
- Pair New window is 15 seconds;
- canonical profile word is STANDARD;
- disconnected Saved Devices word is DISCONNECTED;
- names render first 21 supported characters, fallback `UNKNOWN MOUSE`;
- BLE HOGP only;
- Escape retained through minimal fixed USB Keyboard output;
- no Bluetooth Keyboard/Composite product support.

## Accepted clean rebuild baseline

Accepted product `main` now includes MBR-02:

`tiagooliveirajs/mouse-bridge-remapper@34f5806763503c79aa98e54923a3ec854b11d270`

MBR-01 established the compileable host/Pico 2 W scaffold, frozen module/dependency graph, single-authoritative-Mouse slot, separate non-authoritative Pair New candidate scaffold, architecture ownership guards and pinned G06-derived CI/toolchain baseline. The exact accepted implementation branch head was `826c50dab3b105c6bcecef6a6dbba401506aefc9`; exact-head CI run `35477941473` passed host/architecture and Pico 2 W production jobs.

## Current UX amendment

The 2026-09-20 connected-HOME amendment is recorded in `requirements/2026-09-20-connected-home-pair-new.md`. A later 2026-09-20 amendment for `home-searching-help` is recorded in `requirements/2026-09-20-home-searching-help.md` and changes only that screen's literal wording.

## Historical MBR-02 implementation state

MBR-02 implementation was integrated from product branch `mbr/mbr-02-host-ux-model`, PR #2. Amended implementation head: `ec21f11685e3e80cbb119560a4e8d5cd4e8a6ff0`. Integrated main: `34f5806763503c79aa98e54923a3ec854b11d270`.

Host CI on that exact SHA passed all four contracts:

- `bootstrap_contract`;
- `ux_golden_contract`;
- `ux_behavior_contract`;
- `architecture_contract`.

The implementation covers the 30 canonical screens, release interaction, Help/Lock, HOME/search transactions, stale IDs, Pair New candidate/handoff semantics, name/status/profile projection, Custom draft, confirmation-only success and semantic colors.

Historical pre-reset MBR-02 evidence is retained below. The active clean rebuild baseline is `mbr/rebuild-00-through-04` at `8bebe26ff7554ffa811a58ea024cae5fe80a4a84`; the operator accepted MBR-00 through MBR-04 physically on 2026-09-20. MBR-05 is implemented on `mbr/mbr-05-ble-mouse` at `7f294a7fac9eebe226ad66c6b572582c5e483421` with green host/Pico CI; physical acceptance is pending.

## Evidence boundary

This planner branch records the user's explicit bypass of intermediate physical-gate dependency for an isolated recovery. The product branch `experimental/mbr08-integrated-recovery-20260920` reworks the MBR-05 connection path and implements MBR-06, MBR-07 and MBR-08 together. Automated host/radio/Pico verification is green; physical acceptance is not inferred. MBR-09 and MBR-10 remain outside this candidate.


## MBR-03 historical implementation evidence

The renderer/HAT candidate is built and green in CI, with exact production and qualification UF2 hashes recorded in `executions/mbr-03/candidate.md`. Physical acceptance remains the only open condition for mbr-03.
