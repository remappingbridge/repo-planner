## Operator result

Operator declaration: **PASS / GATE ACCEPTED**.

Declaration received from the operator on 2026-09-23: `gate aceito`.

Candidate `96fff0d5c304166883419c11693e3dba4e10b556` is the physically accepted HOPE-27 implementation.

A cosmetic title improvement from `DEVICE NOT FOUND HELP` to `MOUSE NOT FOUND HELP` was requested after acceptance. Per operator instruction, that improvement is intentionally carried into the next gate rather than reopening HOPE-27.
