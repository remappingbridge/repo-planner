## Required physical scenarios

1. With a connected saved Mouse, open HOME and confirm there is no `LEARN THE KEYS` option.
2. Confirm connected HOME exposes only remapping options, saved devices and Pair New Mouse.
3. Use Joy Up/Down repeatedly and confirm selection wraps only among those 3 options; no blank fourth option is selectable.
4. Open each of the 3 options with Joy Press and confirm their original destinations still work.
5. Disconnect a saved Mouse and enter `home-searching`; confirm there is no `LEARN THE KEYS` option.
6. Confirm `home-searching` selection wraps only between Saved Devices and Pair New Mouse.
7. Reach `home-retry`; confirm there is no `LEARN THE KEYS` option and selection wraps only between Saved Devices and Pair New Mouse.
8. Confirm KEY A retry, KEY B search cancellation semantics, HOME Help and global Lock continue to behave as previously accepted.
9. With zero saved Mice, reboot/resolve HOME and confirm the automatic `SEARCHING FIRST MOUSE` bootstrap still appears and can pair the first Mouse.
10. Regression: Saved Devices, remove-this/help-remove-this, Pair New, reconnect, movement/buttons/scroll and all remapping profiles remain functional.
11. Confirm no HOPE-31 or other new gate behavior was introduced.

## Operator result

**PENDING**.

After this gate, remain on HOLD. Do not start any subsequent gate without a new explicit operator order.
