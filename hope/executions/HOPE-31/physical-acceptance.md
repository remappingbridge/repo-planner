2. FIRST MOUSE CONNECTED
3. home-connected
4. saved-devices
5. remove-this

4. Confirm Custom apply remains in EDIT CUSTOM REMAP and no separate Custom Applied page appears.
5. Connected HOME has exactly 3 routes; searching/retry HOME has exactly 2.
6. Verify HOME resolver for connected, saved-offline and zero-saved states.
7. Verify global Lock/unlock on applicable screens and Any Key Back on every Help page.
8. Verify Saved Devices names/order, connected-first behavior and persistence after disconnect/reboot.
9. Verify removal of disconnected and connected saved Mice, including duplicate identity cleanup.
10. Verify Pair New and retry/help flows.
11. Verify Passthrough, Standard, Escape and Custom remapping, including all five WILL BECOME screens.
12. Verify Mouse movement, buttons, wheel/scroll and synthetic Escape output.
13. Verify Logitech Lift handling remains functional.
14. Power-cycle and confirm persisted product state and saved-name behavior remain consistent.
15. Confirm no Keyboard/Composite pairing UI or legacy status page is reachable.
