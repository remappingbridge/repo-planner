# MUI-07 — Scenario, Fault & Bug Evidence Lab

Status: **AUTOMATED PASS / HUMAN SCENARIO+EVIDENCE REVIEW PENDING / PROVISIONAL ON MUI-06**.

Candidate: `remappingbridge/mouse-ui` branch `mui/mui-07-scenario-bug-lab`, commit `8694ae242e81fe2f74b00efede90962d8701161b`.

Evidence: `../executions/mui-07/candidate.md`.

## Objective

Make difficult UX states instantly reproducible and make bug reports self-identifying, deterministic, and useful for rebuilds.

## Dependency status

The planned dependency is MUI-06 ACCEPTED. MUI-06 currently has automated PASS but still awaits explicit human desktop acceptance. On 2026-09-21 the operator explicitly requested implementation of the next gate before that acceptance. MUI-07 was therefore developed **provisionally** from the exact MUI-06 candidate `c621fd538c515fa9591eb80afaf6130dfe6a7add`, without promoting MUI-06 or MUI-07 to `mouse-ui/main`.

## Implemented tasks

1. Defined a 15-scenario deterministic catalog covering first use, first connection, connected/offline HOME states, Help during search, Pair New with live current Mouse, profile pending, dirty Custom, Saved Devices, removal, full registry, timeout, stale result, and late result.
2. Added SDL-free CLI scenario probe plus desktop `--list-scenarios` / `--scenario NAME` and SCN PREV/NEXT controls.
3. Added semantic fault/result injection: success, failure, timeout, disconnect, stale result, late result, and hold-pending.
4. Added deterministic step runner for TAP, ADVANCE_MS, FAULT, HOME, REBOOT, and FACTORY_RESET.
5. Added evidence v1 with scenario, screen, element metadata, clock, scale, selected/effective backlight, state/tone/bounds/text, search/operation tokens, stale count, framebuffer hash, and recent semantic events.
6. Added compact reference plus TXT and JSON formats.
7. Added raw logical framebuffer PPM to evidence bundles.
8. Added regression fixtures for stale-result, late-result, and remove-failed.
9. Added technical/user documentation for scenario startup, faults, evidence generation, and bug reproduction.

## Automated acceptance

- [x] named scenarios initialize deterministically
- [x] fault injections reach expected frontend states without backend code
- [x] same scenario/steps produce same semantic trace/framebuffer hash
- [x] evidence export contains stable screen/element references and relevant presentation settings
- [x] bug evidence generation does not mutate product state except explicit scenario actions
- [x] actual TXT/JSON/PPM bundle files are created and verified by `lab_contract`

Final CI run `35571682117`, head `8694ae242e81fe2f74b00efede90962d8701161b`, completed successfully in both `host-debug` and `host-asan-ubsan`. Both jobs reported `100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 10`, `MUI-07 deterministic scenario catalog PASS`, and SDL smoke PASS. No sanitizer finding was reported.

## Human acceptance

- [ ] select representative difficult states directly by scenario or SCN PREV/NEXT
- [ ] use semantic fault controls and confirm the resulting frontend state is understandable
- [ ] inspect an element and copy the compact scenario-aware bug reference
- [ ] export `mouse-ui-evidence.txt`, `.json`, and `.ppm` and verify they describe the visible state
- [ ] reproduce a saved regression fixture such as `stale-result`, `late-result`, or `remove-failed` from its scenario evidence
- [ ] MUI-06 desktop presentation itself must also be explicitly accepted before MUI-07 can be promoted

Run on Debian:

~~~bash
git fetch origin
git switch mui/mui-07-scenario-bug-lab
git pull
rm -rf build
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure

./build/mouse-ui-lab-probe --list
./build/mouse-ui-lab-probe --all
./build/mouse-ui --list-scenarios
./build/mouse-ui --scenario stale-result
~~~

Inside the SDL application, test SCN PREV/NEXT, FAIL/TIMEOUT/STALE/LATE, Inspector selection, Ctrl+C/COPY REF, and F9/EVIDENCE.

Expected evidence files:

~~~text
mouse-ui-evidence.txt
mouse-ui-evidence.json
mouse-ui-evidence.ppm
~~~

## Forbidden scope

- automatic backend diagnosis
- network/cloud telemetry
- real Bluetooth/USB fault injection
- turning developer evidence metadata into product UI

Candidate review confirms none of these scopes were introduced.

## Rollback / rebuild point

Scenario definitions, evidence format, and regression tests are the durable assets. The SDL shell implementation may be replaced freely. If MUI-06 is rejected, MUI-07 must be rebased/revalidated on the replacement accepted desktop baseline before promotion.
